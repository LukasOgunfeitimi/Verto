### Verto Developer Test

I used the Red Hat Display font.

I used Tailwind instead of Foundation as I have a lot more experience with it.

I inlcuded the backup within the project

### Notes
As there is a short time frame for this and I am in the middle of my last few weeks of university I didn't get to do as much as I would like so hopefully this will prove enough.
